# Jeroen
I'm Jeroen, a software developer.<br>
I mostly program a lot of random stuff that I like or need, but I also have actual projects!<br>
Have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/JrnJ?tab=repositories">repositories</a> :)

<h1>Languages</h1>
I'm a backend programmer in a variety of languages, my favourite languages are C#, C++, Java and JavaScript.<br>

# My Projects
<h3>Music Player</h3>
An open-source music player for Windows made with WPF using MVVM.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/JrnJ/MusicPlayer/">Source</a>

<h3>2D Survival Game</h3>
I plan on making a 2D survival game with C++ and OpenGL without the use of an existing engine.<br>
After realizing my C++ knowldege was too little, I stopped working on the game. The source code of that project can be found <a href="https://tools.jeroenj.com/">here</a>.<br>
As of now, I'm relearning C++ using <a href="https://learncpp.com/">LearnCPP</a> tutorial instead of the too basic w3schools tutorial.

<h3>Other</h3>
There are a lot of random tools on my <a href="https://tools.jeroenj.com/">website</a>.
